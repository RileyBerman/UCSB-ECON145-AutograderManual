# Introduction 

This manual explains how to build an autograder for [UCSB ECON 145](https://econ.ucsb.edu/programs/undergraduate/courses) coding assignments.

**WHAT IS AN AUTOGRADER?**

In this manual, an *autograder*, or *autograder program*, is an R script that grades a student's R-based assignment and provides question-specific feedback. It runs alongside a set of supporting R scripts, collectively known as the *autograder infrastructure.*

See [Autograder Conventions](#Autograder-Conventions) for more details.

In ECON 145 assignments, coding questions are classified as either [**Public**](#Public-Questions) or [**Private**](#Private-Questions). 

-   For any Public Question, we write custom "Checks" -- lines of code that test for specific answer attributes -- that evaluate the student's answer and return *constructive and dynamic feedback*. 

-   For any Private Question, we use a set of premade functions that evaluate the student's answer and return *necessary and basic feedback*. 

Accordingly, most of this manual focuses on writing Checks for Public Questions. 

We will look at grading four types of data structures: tibbles, vectors, lists, and plots. Moreover, as the majority of ECON 145 assignment questions are tibble-based, we  direct our attention to grading tibbles. 

For fellow ECON 145 TAs, we recommend skimming through [`00-manual1.pdf`](#resources) and [`how_to_create_an_autograder_2024.pdf`](#resources) for an overview of the autograder infrastructure.
